# Let's Restore 🕒

> **⚠️ Work in Progress**: This project is currently under active development. Expect frequent updates and experimental features.

**Let's Restore** is a robust, local-first file versioning and restoration system. Think of it as "Git for everyone"—it allows you to track changes in any local directory and restore previous versions of files or entire folders with a single click. No accounts, no cloud, just pure local protection.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Syncing**: High-performance watcher detects file changes instantly and protects your work as you go.
- **Visual Version Timeline**: Browse through snapshots of your files with a clean, intuitive history view.
- **Smart Restoration**: Accidentally deleted a file? Modified something you shouldn't have? Restore individual files or entire directory structures to any previous point in time.
- **Local-First Architecture**: All versions are stored in a hidden `.restorex` folder inside your directory. Your data never leaves your machine.
- **Premium UI**: A modern, minimalist glassmorphic dashboard built for speed and clarity.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Vanilla CSS for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Desktop Wrapper**: Electron
- **Native Core**: Custom C++ implementation for low-latency file monitoring

## 📂 How It Works

When you start syncing a folder, the app creates a hidden `.restorex` directory:
- `versions/`: Stores compressed/full copies of your files timestamped for recovery.
- `metadata.json`: A local database tracking every change, version ID, and file status.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v16 or higher
- **npm**: for dependency management
- **C++ Compiler**: (Optional) if you wish to rebuild the native watcher component

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arpitsehal/restore.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies for all components:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   cd ../electron && npm install
   ```
